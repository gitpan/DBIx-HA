DBIx/HA version 0.91
====================

DBIx::HA is a High Availability module for DBI. It is implemented by
overloading the DBI connect, prepare and execute methods and can
be seamlessly used without code modification except for initialization.

DBIx::HA also works seamlessly with Apache::DBI when available, and
ensures that cached database handles in the Apache::DBI module are properly
released when failing over.

Features of DBIx::HA are:

- multiple failovers
Should a datasource become unavailable, queries are automatically sent to
the next available datasource in a user-configured datasource stack.
All subsequent queries continue to hit the failover server until
reinitialized. This ensures that a failed datasource can be properly brought
back online before it is put back in service.

- timeouts
Database calls are wrapped in user-configurable timeouts. Connect and execute
timeouts are handled independently.

- configurable retries
Queries can be retried n times before a datasource is considered failed.

- callback function
A user-defined callback function can be called upon abnormal failure and
disconnection from a datasource in order to perform housekeeping tasks unique
to the user's application.

- inter-process automatic failover under mod_perl
Failover can be triggered for a single process or a set of processes at the
application level. Specifically designed for Apache's multi-process model,
if one mod_perl process triggers a failover, it is propagated to all other
mod_perl processes using the same database handle.


DBIx::HA was designed primarily for reliability and speed. Functionality
that would compromise speed was not considered. This module has been tested
extensively at very high loads in the Apache/mod_perl/Sybase environment.
