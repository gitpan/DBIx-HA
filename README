DBIx/HA version 0.54
====================

DBIx::HA is a High Availability module for DBI. It is implemented byoverloading the DBI connect, prepare and execute methods and canbe seamlessly used without code modification except for initialization.DBIx::HA also works seamlessly with Apache::DBI when available, andensures that cached database handles in the Apache::DBI module are properlyreleased when failing over.Features of DBIx::HA are:- multiple failoversShould a datasource become unavailable, queries are automatically sent tothe next available datasource in a user-configured datasource stack.All subsequent queries continue to hit the failover server untilreinitialized. This ensures that a failed datasource can be properly broughtback online before it is put back in service.- timeoutsDatabase calls are wrapped in user-configurable timeouts. Connect and executetimeouts are handled independently.- configurable retriesQueries can be retried n times before a datasource is considered failed.- callback functionA user-defined callback function can be called upon abnormal failure anddisconnection from a datasource in order to clean locally cached handles andperform other housekeeping tasks.- inter-process automatic failover under mod_perlFailover can be triggered for a single process or a set of processes at theapplication level. Specifically designed for Apache's multi-process model,if one mod_perl process triggers a failover, it is propagated to all othermod_perl processes using the same database handle.DBIx::HA was designed primarily for reliability and speed. Functionalitythat would compromise speed was not considered. This module has been testedextensively at very high loads in the Apache/mod_perl/Sybase environment.
